CHANGES WHAT THE PERSON AT THE IDE SEES, immediately and everywhere, so a garish test colour is visible to them until it is taken back. Nothing is written to disk: the snippet lives in memory, is gone after a restart or a theme change, and 'reset' takes it back at once. Each call re-applies the current theme first, so snippets replace each other instead of piling up, and the answer says how many rules were parsed and reports the parse errors the engine raised, which is where a selector typo shows up. An IEclipsePreferences block, the way themes set JDT syntax colours, takes effect when a theme is activated, which this tool cannot do; it drives the engine's own preference styling all the same and reads every key back, since the engine leaves a value it did not set itself alone until the theme has changed this session. eclipse_set_theme activates a theme and applies such blocks outright. This is what turns a theme question into an experiment: apply a rule with an unmistakable colour, then read eclipse_inspect_widget to see whether it matched, rather than rebuilding a theme plug-in and restarting for every attempt."; //$NON-NLS-1$
