		return "Waits until the UI looks to have stopped working, then reports how it decided and WHAT IT COULD NOT SEE. Changes nothing. THIS IS A HEURISTIC, NOT A GUARANTEE, and the answer says so in every case: use it to reduce flakiness before a capture, and assert the thing you actually need rather than trusting it. It observes two mechanisms. Work queued with asyncExec is drained by posting a fence to the Display and waiting for it, which is the only way to drain that queue from outside the UI thread, and how long the fence took is itself the measurement, since a fence that waits is a UI thread that was busy. The job manager reports what is running, waiting or SLEEPING, and a sleeping job counts as busy because a decoration scheduled to run after a build is exactly the case a capture taken too early misses. It settles only after several consecutive rounds find both quiet, with a pause between them so that briefly delayed work has a chance to appear. It also checks the text editors' RECONCILERS, which is the case that hurt most and the only one of the three that is not public API: AbstractReconciler starts as a job and hands its work to a plain daemon thread, so it is invisible to both mechanisms above and semantic highlighting landed after everything observable had gone quiet. It is reached the way JDT's own performance tests reach it, reflecting into SourceViewer.fReconciler, then AbstractReconciler.fWorker, then isDirty and isActive, plus a JavaReconciler's own initial-pass flag. Those names are internal and can change in any release, so a reconciler that cannot be read counts as BUSY rather than idle: the failure is a settle that never succeeds, never one that succeeds too early. WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE is any other plain background thread, and work that has not been scheduled yet. This differs from eclipse_wait_until_quiet, which lives in the headless core and therefore knows only the job manager; this one also drains the display queue, which is what the job manager cannot see. Inside eclipse_run_script with atomic it refuses, because a fence posted from the UI thread would be run by the thread waiting for it."; //$NON-NLS-1$
